# AbleTP
A Thermal Printer library using ArduinoBLE and Adafruit GFX to control MPTII style printers.

Testing was done using a GOOJPRT PT-210. It runs the MPTII firmware.

ArduinoBLE allows multiple methods of scanning to find the proper printer (MAC, Name and UUID).
If you need to find printer info like a scannable printer name or MAC address, you can run a test print and that info will be printed out (most printers will do this). 


To run a test print:

1.  Make sure printer power is OFF.
2.  Hold down the form feed button.
3.  Press the power button to ON.
4.  Printer should automatically print a test page.

To find printer UUID, you can use a BLE scanner app likeâ€¦

You may be able to use these sketches with other Thermal Printers by changing the UUID settings to match your printer. That has not been tested.




*** The example below creates a simple data logger. It will print out data (every 5~6 seconds) to the
printer as long as the printer BLE is connected. If the printer disconnects
the data restart after reconnect (any data while disconnected will be lost).
If the micro-controller restarts, the entire sketch restarts. ***

*** The example below draws Adafruit_GFX graphics to the printer.
It uses the controllers memory as a buffer (canvas).
Once the image is drawn to the canvas, the canvas is printed to the printer via BLE. ***

*** The example below prints the printer's built in barcode functions. ***

*** The example below prints many of the normal ESC/POS commands to the connected BLE printer. ***
